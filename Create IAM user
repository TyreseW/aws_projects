# Create an IAM User

## **Task Overview**
This document outlines the steps taken to configure IAM security best practices in AWS.

### Steps Completed ###
* Created a new user with IAM Console Access
* Add user to an Admin group
  * Created new group called 'AccountAdmin'
  * Added 'AdministratorAccess' managed policy to the new group
  * Added new user to the 'AccountAdmin' group
* Enabled MFA to the root user
* Applied an IAM password policy using security best practices

* What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
  - A service that helps you securely manage access to your AWS resources. Create and control user, groups, roles, and policies to define who can access what within your AWS Environment
* What is a root user?
  - Root user is the initial account owner and is created when you make your account. Root user has unresticted access to all AWS resources
* How is a root user different from an Admin user?
  - Root user is created upon account creation
  - Admin user is an IAM user with the 'AdministratorAccess' policy
  - Root user cannot be restricted by IAM policies; Admin user can be restricted by IAM policies
  - Admin user cannot close an account; Admin cannot change root user password or MFA
* What is console access and programmatic access?
  - Console Access is made via a web-based management console. Programmatic access is made via CLI, API's or SDK's
* What is the access key and secret key?
  - Access keys are used to authenticate and authorize programmatic access to AWS services. Secret key is a part of the access key
* What is MFA and why is it important?
  - Multi-factor Authentication(MFA) is an extra security layer that requires you to provide two forms of authentication; Further protects against unauthorized access to your resources
* What are policies and how can you create them?
  - Policies are JSON documents that allow you to specify who can access AWS resources, and what actions they can perform on those resources
* What are roles and how can you create them?
  - A role is an IAM identity you create that has specific permissions. A role can be associated with multiple AWS entities.
* What is the difference between a role and a policy?
  - Roles are assumed by AWS entities; Policies are attached to roles and define what actions are permitted by that role
* What is a user group?
  - A user group is a collection of multiple IAM users. Allows you to manage the permissions of multiple users at once.
* What are some good security practices for password policies?
  - minimum length of 12 characters
  - require at least one uppercase letter
  - require at least one lowercase letter
  - require at least one number
  - require at least one non-alphnumeric character
